# Lexo Software Instructions

In this manual, we will be going through the steps to setup the application and how to use it.

# Requirements
  
- Git
- Node & NPM
- Expo Go Android/iOS Application or Android/iOS Emulator

# Setup

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/G1GACHADS/lexo_frontend.git
```

Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

To start the application, run

```bash
npm start
```

## Install Expo Go / Emulator

To run the application on your phone, you will need to download the **Expo Go** application from the **Play Store** or **App Store**. Otherwise if you have an emulator you can skip this step

Once you have the application installed, you can scan the QR code that appears in the terminal after running `npm start` or you can type the command `a` to run the application on an Android emulator or `i` to run the application on an iOS emulator (NOTE: make sure the emulator is up and running!)

## Trying it out

Try to take a picture of a book, poster, or any other kind of documents that contains text. Alternatively, you can upload an image from your gallery

Once the app finishes processing the image, you can now see the text that was extracted from the image in bionic text form.

## Additional Things

Here are some additional things you could do in the app to enhance your reading experience:

- You can use Text-to-Speech feature to listen to the text that was extracted from the image.

And that is it! You can now use the application to extract text from images and convert it to bionic text.
