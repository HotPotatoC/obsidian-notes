# Software Project Management

Software project management is an essential part of software engineering.

The main goals of software project management are
- To deliver the software to the customer at the agreed time
- To keep overall costs within budget
- To deliver software that meets the customer's expectations
- To maintain a coherent and well-functioning development team

## Factors

Some important factors that affect how software projects are managed are:
- **Company size**
- **Software customers**
- **Software size**
- **Software type**
- **Organization culture**
- **Sofware development**

## Fundamental Activities

Previous factors mean that project managersr in different organizations may work in quite different way

The fundamental project management activities are:
- **Project planning**
- **Risk management**
- **People management**
- **Reporting**
- **Proposal writing**

# The management spectrum

Effective software project management focuses on the four P's:
- **People**
- **Product**
- **Process**
- **Project**

## People

Participate in the software process and the way they are organized to perform effective software engineering (Stakeholders)

- **Senior managers (product owners)**: who define the business issues that often have a significant influence on the project
- **Project (technical) managers (Scrum masters or team leads)**: who must plan, motivate, organizie, and coordinate the practitioners who do software work
- **Practitioners**: who deliver the technical skills that are necessary to engineer a product or application
- **Customers**: who specify the requirements for the software tobe engineered and other stakeholders who have a peripheral interest in the outcome.
- **End users**: who interact with the software once it is released for production use.

## Product

Examine the product and the problem it is intended to solve at the very beginning of the project

Software scope: unambiguous and understandable at the management and technicial levels
- **Context**: How does the software to be built fit into a larger system, product, or business context, and what constraints are imposed as a result of the context?
- **Information objectives**: What customer-visible data objects are produced as output from the software? What data objects are required for input?
- **Function and performance**: What function does the software perform to transform input data into output? Are any special performance caracteristics to be addressed?

## Process

A generic process framework for software engineering encompasses five activities:
- Communication
- Planning
- Modeling
- construction
- Deployment

Decide which process model is most appropriate for:
- The customers who have requested the prodct and the people who will do the work
- The characteristics of the product
- The project environment in which the software team works

Define project:
- Four P's
- W5HH Principle
