# Software Quality

Software Quality can be defined as an effective software process applied in a manner that creates a useful product that provides measurable value for those who produce it and those who use it.

For software, two kinds of quality may be encountered:
- **Quality of Design** encompasses requirements, specifications, and the design of the system
- **Quality of Conformance** is an issue focused primarily on implementation
- User Satisfaction = Compliant Product + Good Quality + Delivery within budget and schedule

There are 5 kinds of pragmatic view on software quality:
- **Transcendental View**
- **User View**
- **Manifacturer's View**
- **Product View**
- **Value-based View**

## Effective Software Process

An **Effective Software Process** establishes the infrastructure that supports any effort at building a high quality software product.

**The management aspects** of process create the checks and balances that help avoid project chaos (a key contributor to poor quality)

**Risk analysis** also comes into play. Software engineering practices allow the developer to analyze the problem and design a solid solution which both are critical to building a high quality software

**Umbrella activities** such as change management and technical reviews have as much to do with quality as any other part of software engineering practice.
