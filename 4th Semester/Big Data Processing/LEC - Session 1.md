# Big Data Processing

It it important to note that when we process big data, there should **never be any data loss**. The process should **not hinder the user experience**.

# Storage Growth and Digitization

Until 2023, we often store data in the cloud. Because of the nature of cloud computing in this era, it is a lot easier to manage data and scaling up. Also, it is important to be aware that storing data in the cloud is not a *silver bullet*.

# What is Big Data?

**Big data** in simple terms is just a large amount of data.

In big data there are multiple challenges
- Capture
- Storage
- Analysis
- Search
- Sharing
- Transfer
- Visualization
- Querying
- Updating
- Information privacy

# Big Data Characteristics

In big data there is the term $nV$.

The main $4V$ in big data stands for
- Volume: refers to batch processing
- Velocity: refers to the speed at which data is being generated and needs to be processed (realtime processing)
- Variety: refers to the variety of data types and sources (SQL, NoSQL, JSON, Static Files, CDN, etc.)
- Veracity: refers to the quality, accuracy, and reliability of the data
