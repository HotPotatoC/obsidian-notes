Data
- Ingestion layer (input)
- Platform Management (Process) -> Apache Spark
- Storage Layer (Output) -> MySQL
- Visualization Layer (Output)

Distributed Computing -> Multiple machines but feels like only one single machine (map reduce being one of the core algorithm)
Parallel Computing -> Only one machine but many processors

Main Components of big data processing
- HDFS / GFS (Storing files in distributed disks)
- Map Reduce (Batch Distributed Computing)
