Hello and welcome to my journey on getting the **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Certificate**.

Throughout my journey to achieve the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification, I have discovered the immense potential of cloud computing and the many benefits it offers. As I navigated through the learning process, I realized how the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification is not only a reflection of technical expertise but also an indicator of one's ability to think critically, make informed decisions, and provide valuable insights into cloud computing solutions.

In this journey, I have gained a deeper understanding of cloud concepts, AWS core services, security, pricing, and support. I have learned how to deploy and manage infrastructure, develop applications, and automate tasks using AWS services. Along the way, I have also discovered how AWS has helped organizations of all sizes to innovate, scale, and grow their business.

My notes serve as a testament to my dedication to gaining expertise in AWS Cloud computing and my commitment to advancing my career in the technology industry. I hope they will serve as a valuable resource not only for me but also for others looking to gain knowledge in this field.

In this journey, I will mainly use [Freecodecamp's - AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Certification Course (CLF-C01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOTamWNgDKc) video as my learning resource.
